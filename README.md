# Project 0: Person201

This project uses a `Person201` class to keep track of data about many individuals. We will use this along with static utility methods from `Person201Utilities` and main/driver methods from `Person201Demo` and `Person201Finder` to search for individuals in Compsci 201 who are near each other on campus.

Coursework from Duke CS 201: Data Structures and Algorithms.
